# Tiny renderer
My attempt to create simplified clone of OpenGl and find out how it works.

## Features
1. Draw lines
2. Draw anti-aliased lines (Wu's algorith)
3. Draw wireframe render of .obj models ![Wireframe render](https://pp.userapi.com/c836126/v836126753/5ef20/0PnJAjQeAik.jpg)

## Usage
Clone it to your computer and compile.

    git clone https://github.com/shigabeev/tinyrenderer
    make makefile
    ./main obj/african_head.obj

You can select model to render by adding path to .obj file. There are some of them in /obj
